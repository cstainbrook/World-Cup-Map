# World Cup Map

### What's in this Repo
This repo contains the code for an interactive map I made to practice using D3.js and to improve my data visualization skills.

### Replicating the Project

##### Set up a local server
In the command line, navigate to the map_example directory.  Then run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`.  This sets up a local server, which can be accessed by using a web browser and typing localhost:8000 in the url bar.

##### Run 01_globe.html
In the web browser, click on the link for 01_globe.html
